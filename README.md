## RGB-Color-Game

Completed: November 2016

### Summary:
The Great RGB Color Game was created as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. I continued with the Color game and 
added several tweaks not included in the course. 
 
### Additional features:
 
I add several features to the game including sounds effects, a toggle button to turn sound on/off and a "help" button for
instructions on how to play the game.
 
### What I learned:
 
Aiming to dig deeper into Javascript but also get hands-on experience, this project has really helped further my understanding
of DOM Manipulation such as selecting DOM elements, creating event listeners and dynamically changing CSS styles to elements.
